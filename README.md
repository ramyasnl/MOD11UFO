<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
We have recreated Danaâ€™s webpage , by adding more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.<br/> In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.<br/>

**To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`


### Built With

* JavaScript
*  HTML
